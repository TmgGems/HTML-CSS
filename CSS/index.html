    ( pseudo-classes are used to select and style elements based on their current state or specific relationships with other elements, beyond their default state. Pseudo-classes are denoted by a colon (:) followed by the name of the pseudo-class.

Some common pseudo-classes in CSS include:

:hover: Selects an element when the user hovers over it with the mouse pointer.
:active: Selects an element when it is being activated or clicked by the user.
:focus: Selects an element when it gains focus (e.g., when you click on an input field).
:first-child: Selects an element that is the first child of its parent.
:last-child: Selects an element that is the last child of its parent.
:nth-child(): Selects elements based on their position within their parent element.
:not(): Selects elements that do not match the given selector.
:checked: Selects input elements that are checked, such as radio buttons or checkboxes.
)

    (the <span> element is an inline-level container used to group and apply styles to a specific portion of text or other inline elements. It does not add any semantic meaning of its own but is rather a general-purpose container that allows you to target and style specific parts of a larger block of content.)
