        Thinkin' 'bout the days when we used to walk
        Holdin' each other's hands and we talked
        I will never let you cry, let us fly to somewhere far across this world
        But maybe it was meant to, baby, I just sent you
        Breakin' this heart and breakin' the love
        I will never let you cry, let us fly to somewhere far across this world.
